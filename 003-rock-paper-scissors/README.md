# Third TOP project: Rock Paper Scissors
In this project the goal is to make a simple implementation off the classic "rock paper scissors", in the browser console from scratch. [Project guideline](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

UPDATE: After learning about DOM manipulation and events in .js, an update of the project is requested to include a basic UI to interact with the user. [Revisiting RPS Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/revisiting-rock-paper-scissors).

I decided to update the classic game to include the "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" [big bang theory variant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8).
